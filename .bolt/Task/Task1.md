# Task 1: Project Infrastructure Setup & Monorepo Architecture

## 🎯 Objective
Setup the foundational monorepo architecture for Xalesin ERP with proper tooling, configuration, and development environment.

## 📋 Requirements
- Initialize monorepo structure with proper workspace configuration
- Setup development tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Configure build tools and package management
- Establish coding standards and conventions

## 🏗️ Implementation Steps

### 1. Monorepo Structure Creation
```
xalesin-erp/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                     # React + Vite Web Application
│   └── native/                  # React Native + Expo Mobile App
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                    # Shared Business Logic
│   ├── ui/                      # Tamagui Universal Components
│   ├── config/                  # Configuration
│   └── eslint-config/           # Shared ESLint configuration
├── tools/                       # Development tools
├── docs/                        # Documentation
└── package.json                 # Root package.json with workspaces
```

### 2. Package Manager Configuration
- Setup npm/yarn workspaces
- Configure package.json with workspace definitions
- Setup dependency management strategy

### 3. Development Tools Setup
- ESLint configuration for TypeScript
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for git hooks
- Lint-staged for pre-commit checks

### 4. TypeScript Configuration
- Root tsconfig.json with project references
- Shared TypeScript configurations
- Path mapping for monorepo packages

### 5. Build Tools Configuration
- Turborepo for build orchestration
- Vite configuration for web app
- Metro configuration for React Native

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monorepo structure is created with all required folders
- [ ] Package.json workspaces are properly configured
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works across all packages
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier are configured and working
- [ ] Build system can compile all packages
- [ ] Development scripts are functional

## 🔗 Dependencies
- None (Foundation task)

## 📊 Estimated Effort
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours
- **Priority**: Critical (Blocking)

## 📝 Notes
- This is the foundation task that enables all other development
- Proper setup here will save significant time in later tasks
- Follow enterprise-grade monorepo best practices
- Ensure scalability for future modules and features

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- All packages can be built successfully
- Linting passes without errors
- TypeScript compilation is error-free
- Development environment is fully functional
