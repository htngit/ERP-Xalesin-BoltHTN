## 1. Database Architecture (Supabase PostgreSQL)

### 🏗️ Enterprise Database Design

The database follows **enterprise ERP standards** with proper normalization, referential integrity, and audit trails. Current implementation includes:

### Core ERP Modules Schema

#### 💰 Financial Management
```sql
-- Multi-currency support
currencies (id, code, name, symbol, exchange_rate, is_active)
exchange_rates (id, from_currency_id, to_currency_id, rate, effective_date)
tax_rates (id, name, rate, type, is_active, tenant_id)
```

#### 📄 Document Management System
```sql
-- Automated document numbering and lifecycle
document_types (id, name, code, prefix, next_number, tenant_id)
document_sequences (id, document_type_id, year, last_number, tenant_id)
documents (id, document_type_id, number, date, status, total_amount, tenant_id)
```

#### 👥 Party Management (CRM)
```sql
-- Unified customer/supplier/employee management
parties (id, name, type, email, phone, tax_number, is_active, tenant_id)
addresses (id, party_id, type, street, city, state, country, postal_code)
```

#### 📦 Inventory Management
```sql
-- Multi-warehouse with batch tracking
warehouses (id, name, address, description, tenant_id)
locations (id, warehouse_id, name, description, tenant_id)
product_categories (id, name, description, tenant_id)
items (id, name, sku, category_id, unit_price, tenant_id)
batches (id, item_id, batch_number, production_date, expiry_date, quantity)
movement_lines (id, location_id, item_id, batch_id, quantity, movement_type, document_id)
inventory_movements (id, reference, document_type, user_id, tenant_id)
```

### 🔗 Integration Architecture

**Cross-Module Relationships:**
- `documents.party_id` → `parties.id` (Customer/Supplier linkage)
- `documents.currency_id` → `currencies.id` (Multi-currency transactions)
- `inventory_movements.document_id` → `documents.id` (Document-driven inventory)
- `movement_lines.tax_rate_id` → `tax_rates.id` (Automated tax calculation)
- All tables include `tenant_id` for multi-tenancy support
- Comprehensive audit trails with `created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### 🚀 Edge Functions (Business Logic)

**Inventory Operations:**
- `inventory_adjustment` - Stock adjustments with approval workflow
- `stock_transfer` - Inter-warehouse transfers
- `realtime_stock_update` - Real-time stock level updates

**Financial Operations:**
- `currency_conversion` - Real-time currency conversion
- `tax_calculation` - Automated tax computation
- `document_numbering` - Sequential document number generation

**Integration Functions:**
- `sales_order_processing` - End-to-end sales workflow
- `purchase_order_processing` - Procurement workflow
- `financial_posting` - Automated journal entries

### 🔐 Security Framework

**Row-Level Security (RLS) Strategy:**
- **Multi-tenant isolation** via `tenant_id` policies
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with granular permissions
- **Data encryption** for sensitive financial information
- **Audit logging** for all critical operations
- **API rate limiting** and **SQL injection protection**

⚠️ **Development Note**: Use **relaxed RLS policies** during development. Implement **strict enterprise-grade policies** before production deployment.

---

## 4. UI Layer

### 📱 Cross-Platform Responsiveness Strategy

To ensure optimal user experience across platforms:

* Use **Tamagui responsive props** (`size`, `flexDirection`, `padding`, etc.)
* Detect platform using `Platform.OS` to conditionally style based on Web vs Mobile
* Web focuses on **wide layouts, grid/table views**
* Native focuses on **stacked, scrollable layouts** for small viewports

> 💡 Keep in mind: Write components once, then adjust layout or styling via `mediaQueries` or platform-aware conditions.

### Tamagui Setup:

* Shared styled components: `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Table`, etc.
* Theme + Variant config in `tamagui.config.ts`
* Responsive and cross-platform UI

### Platform-specific folders (if needed):

```
components/
├── shared/
├── web/
├── native/
```

---

## 5. Navigation

### Web:

* React Router DOM
* Vite routing (optional manual routes)

### Native:

* `expo-router` (file-based routing ala Next.js)
* Auto-matches folder structure inside `/app`
