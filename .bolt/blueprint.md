The Plan
1. Database Implementation (Supabase)
This phase focuses on extending your existing Supabase schema to support comprehensive warehouse management and preparing for real-time capabilities.

Define warehouses table:

You should create a new table named warehouses to store information about different storage facilities.
This table should include columns such as id (UUID, primary key), name (text, unique), address (text), description (text, nullable), and created_at (timestamp with time zone, default now()).
This table will serve as the parent for storage locations.
Define locations table:

You should create a new table named locations to represent specific storage areas within warehouses (e.g., aisles, shelves, bins).
This table should include columns such as id (UUID, primary key), warehouse_id (UUID, foreign key referencing warehouses.id), name (text, unique within a warehouse), description (text, nullable), and created_at (timestamp with time zone, default now()).
You should add a foreign key constraint from locations.warehouse_id to warehouses.id with ON DELETE CASCADE.
Define product_categories table:

You should create a new table named product_categories to categorize items.
This table should include columns such as id (UUID, primary key), name (text, unique), description (text, nullable), and created_at (timestamp with time zone, default now()).
You should add a foreign key constraint from items.category_id (new column to be added to items) to product_categories.id.
Define batches table:

You should create a new table named batches for batch/lot tracking of items.
This table should include columns such as id (UUID, primary key), item_id (UUID, foreign key referencing items.id), batch_number (text, unique per item), production_date (date, nullable), expiry_date (date, nullable), quantity (numeric, default 0), and created_at (timestamp with time zone, default now()).
You should add a foreign key constraint from batches.item_id to items.id with ON DELETE CASCADE.
Update items table:

You should add a category_id column (UUID, nullable, foreign key referencing product_categories.id) to the items table. This will allow items to be categorized.
Update movement_lines table:

You should modify the movement_lines table to use the new locations table. The existing warehouse_id column should be replaced with location_id (UUID, foreign key referencing locations.id). This will track movements to specific locations within a warehouse.
You should add a batch_id column (UUID, nullable, foreign key referencing batches.id) to movement_lines to support batch tracking for movements.
Implement Supabase Edge Functions:

You should create a Supabase Edge Function for inventory_adjustment that handles changes in stock levels, updating batches.quantity and creating corresponding movement_lines. This function should validate quantities and ensure data consistency.
You should create a Supabase Edge Function for stock_transfer to manage movements of items between locations, updating quantities in relevant batches and creating movement_lines for both source and destination.
You should create a Supabase Edge Function for realtime_stock_update that can be triggered by database changes (e.g., movement_lines inserts) to update a materialized view or a summary table for real-time stock levels.
Implement Row Level Security (RLS):

You should enable RLS on all new warehouse-related tables (warehouses, locations, product_categories, batches) and ensure that items, inventory_movements, and movement_lines also have appropriate RLS policies.
You should define policies that restrict access based on tenant_id (if applicable) and user roles (e.g., only 'Accountant' or 'Admin' can modify stock).
2. Core Components Development (Sequential Priority)
This phase outlines the development of the application's core features in the specified order.

Authentication and User Management:

You should expand the existing authentication system (src/lib/auth.tsx, src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx) to include user registration (if needed) and password reset functionality.
You should develop a user management interface (src/pages/Users.tsx) that allows administrators to view, create, edit, and deactivate users. This interface should integrate with Supabase's auth.users table and potentially a custom profiles table for additional user metadata and roles.
You should implement role-based access control (RBAC) logic within the application, leveraging user roles stored in Supabase to control UI elements and API access.
Dashboard and Navigation System:

You should enhance the src/pages/Dashboard.tsx to display real-time data from the database, including key financial metrics and inventory summaries.
You should update the src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx to include new navigation links for the warehouse management module and other upcoming features.
Warehouse Management Module:

Location Management Interface: You should create a new page (src/pages/WarehouseLocations.tsx) to manage warehouses and locations. This page should allow for CRUD operations on these tables.
Product Categories Interface: You should create a new page (src/pages/ProductCategories.tsx) to manage product_categories, allowing for CRUD operations.
Item Management Interface: You should enhance the existing items management (if any, or create src/pages/ItemManagement.tsx) to include the new category_id and display stock levels from batches. This page should allow for CRUD operations on items.
Stock Tracking Interface: You should develop a dedicated page (src/pages/StockTracking.tsx) that displays current inventory levels per item, per location, and per batch. This page should utilize data from items, batches, and locations.
Inventory Movement Forms: You should create forms (src/components/forms/InventoryMovementForm.tsx) for recording various types of inventory movements (e.g., goods receipt, goods issue, internal transfers, adjustments). These forms will interact with the Supabase Edge Functions for inventory operations.
Batch Tracking Interface: You should create a page (src/pages/BatchTracking.tsx) to view and manage batches, including their quantities, production dates, and expiry dates.
Barcode/QR Code Scanning Support: You should integrate a client-side library for barcode/QR code scanning into the inventory movement forms to facilitate quick item identification.
Reporting and Analytics Components:

You should develop new pages (src/pages/InventoryReports.tsx, src/pages/FinancialReports.tsx) for generating reports based on the collected data.
For inventory, reports should include stock on hand, movement history, and potentially slow-moving or fast-moving items.
For financial data, you should implement the Neraca (Balance Sheet), Laba Rugi (Income Statement), and Arus Kas (Cash Flow Statement using existing transactions and accounts data.
You should implement data export functionality (e.g., to CSV/Excel using xlsx library, or PDF using jspdf) for these reports.
Integration Components with Other ERP Modules:

You should integrate the documents module with inventory movements. For example, a "Sales Order" document could trigger a goods issue movement, and a "Purchase Order" could trigger a goods receipt. This involves updating the inventory_movements table with document_id references.
You should ensure that financial transactions generated from documents (e.g., sales invoices, purchase invoices) correctly update the transactions and transaction_lines tables.
3. Page Implementation (Based on Schema)
All pages should be developed with real data integration, responsive design, and robust error handling.

Warehouse Overview Page: You should create a page that provides a high-level summary of all warehouses, their total stock value, and recent movements.
Inventory Management Page: This page will be the central hub for managing items, batches, and viewing stock levels.
Stock Movement Tracking Page: You should create a page to view a detailed history of all inventory_movements and their movement_lines, with filtering and search capabilities.
Reports and Analytics Pages: You should develop dedicated pages for each financial and inventory report, allowing users to select parameters (e.g., date ranges, specific warehouses).
User Management Page: You should create a page for administrators to manage user accounts and roles.
System Configuration Page: You should implement the src/pages/Settings.tsx page to allow configuration of system-wide settings, such as currency defaults, document numbering sequences, and tax rates.
Error Handling and Loading States: For all data-driven components, you should implement proper loading indicators, error messages, and empty states to provide a smooth user experience.
